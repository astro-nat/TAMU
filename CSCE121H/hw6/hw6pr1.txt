CHAPTER 12: EXERCISES 4, 7, AND 9

4. Draw a 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board of alternating white and red squares.
7. Draw a two-dimensional house seen from the front, the way a child would: with a door, two windows, and a roof with a chimney. Feel free to add details; maybe have "smoke" come out of the chimney.
9. Display an image on the screen, e.g., a photo of a friend. Label the image both with a title on the window and with a caption in the window.
