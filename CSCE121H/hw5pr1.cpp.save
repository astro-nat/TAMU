/* Write a program that implements a rudimentary movie database, called 
MyMDB. It will interact with the user to get and display information 
about movies. The data will be stored in a file so that it will persist 
between invocations of the program. You will need to devise a format for 
storing the information in the file.

The information for each movie should include, at a minimum, the 
following:

title
year
the names of 3 actors/actresses in the movie
genre (e.g., mystery, comedy, horror)
a list of scores (each score should be between 1 and 10)

When the program starts executing, it should query the user for the name 
of the file from which the data is to be obtained. Then it should 
present the user with the following menu of options (you can include 
more options if you like):

enter a new movie and its information
view all information about an existing movie
update the information about an existing movie (including the 
possibility of entering an additional score)
display the average/min/max/median score for a movie
output the titles of all movies starring a particular actor
output the titles of all movies made in a particular year
Before exiting, the program must write the information about all the 
movies to the file. */
