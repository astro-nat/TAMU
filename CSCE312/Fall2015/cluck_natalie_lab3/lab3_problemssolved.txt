Lab 3



Problem 1



1. N/A



2. Solution 1: Timer Resolution = 1 nanoseconds. Calibration time = 0 seconds and 498 nanoseconds. The measured code took 0 seconds and 10714 nano seconds to run.

Solution 2:  Timer Resolution = 1 nanoseconds. Calibration time = 0 seconds and 551 nanoseconds. The measured code took 0 seconds and 93 nano seconds to run.


3. Lab 1 Prob 4: Timer Resolution = 1 nanoseconds. Calibration time = 0 seconds and 460 nanoseconds. The measured code took 0 seconds and 449 nano seconds to run.



4. Solution 1 code is much slower because it has to check all the bits everytime. Solution 2 is fast because it only checks an integer output rather than combining bit sequences. Lab 1 Prob 4 is fast because it’s only making one comparison with a final output, checking each bit once.



5. A faster solution for the slowest problem would be to decrease the number of times the output is changed.



Problem 2



1. SPST: A single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch has one output and one input. The switch will either be closed or completely disconnected. SPSTs are perfect for on-off switching. They’re also a very common form of momentary switches. SPST switches should only require two terminals.

NO: When a button is open until actuated, it is normally open (NO). When actuated, the circuit is closed, also called “push-to-make” switch. 



2. Problem2.circ file. (Should work but keeps showing errors.)



3. Added labels to circuits in problem2.circ file.
